        <p>
          Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final prophet in Islam and is the
          last messenger of Allah. Here are some key aspects of his life and
          significance in Islam:
        </p>
        <h3>Prophethood</h3>
        <p>
          Muhammad (peace be upon him) is regarded as the last prophet in a line
          that includes figures like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Muslims believe
          he was sent by God to deliver His final message to humanity.
        </p>

        <h3>Birth and Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          He was born in Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia, around 570 CE. He
          belonged to the Quraysh tribe, a respected tribe in Mecca. His father,
          Abdullah, died before he was born, and his mother, Amina, passed away
          when he was just six years old. He was raised by his grandfather and
          later by his uncle Abu Talib.
        </p>
        <h3>Revelation</h3>
        <p>
          At the age of 40, Muhammad (peace be upon him) received his first
          revelation from God through the angel Gabriel. This marked the
          beginning of his prophethood. Over the next 23 years, he received a
          series of revelations that were later compiled into the Qur'an.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Growth and Development</h3>
        <p>
          Islam emphasizes personal development and self-improvement. Muslims
          are encouraged to seek knowledge, develop their character, and
          contribute positively to society.
        </p>
        <h3>Mission and Teachings</h3>
        <p>
          Muhammad (peace be upon him) preached monotheism, social justice,
          moral conduct, and the importance of compassion and mercy. His
          teachings emphasize the worship of one God (Allah) and the importance
          of following divine guidance to lead a righteous life.
        </p>

        <h3>Migration and Establishment of the Muslim Community</h3>
        <p>
          In 622 CE, due to persecution in Mecca, Muhammad (peace be upon him)
          and his followers migrated to Medina. This event, known as the Hijra,
          marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, he established
          a community based on Islamic principles.
        </p>
        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          Muhammad (peace be upon him) is highly revered by Muslims as a model
          of righteous behavior. His life and sayings (Hadith) serve as guidance
          for Muslims in various aspects of life. He is often referred to with
          the honorific phrase "peace be upon him" (PBUH) when his name is
          mentioned.
        </p>
        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
          Muhammad (peace be upon him) passed away in 632 CE in Medina. His
          teachings continue to shape the lives of Muslims around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Muhammad's (peace be upon him) life and teachings have had a profound
          impact on Islamic civilization and continue to be a central source of
          guidance for Muslims.
